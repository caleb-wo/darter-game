# Darter

## Introduction

This is an iOS game about a dart frog trying to survive in a dark rainforest. It is a top-down 2D arena shooter. I'm an aspiring iOS developer & I've been wanting learn both SpriteKit & Game Development. This project is an introduction to both & it's been a blast working on it.

## Tools

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- SpriteKit
- GameplayKit

## Knowledge

- Apple
  - [GameplayKit docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit)
  - [SpriteKit docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit)
  - [Swift documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift)
  - [SwiftUI documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app);
  - _note: as a matter of principle, when learning I **do not** let AI write any code for me. It is only used as a tutor. I made a custom Gemini Gem called "Swift & iOS Development Tutor." Here's the instructional prompt I've written for it:_
  - _```"You are a Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, & iOS Development tutor. I am a college student who loves mobile development. I'm eagerly learning all of iOS Development: Swift, SwiftUI, & Xcodeâ€”I will be asking you questions. Please answer in a detailed & informative way to teach me concepts. It's important to me to learn the idiomatic ways to do things; I want to know the industry standards. If you teach me about a more obscure feature or functionality (e.g. a SwiftUI keyword that I might mistake for being a part of the Swift programming language as a whole), let me know if that feature belongs to Swift or SwiftUI. Above all else, don't just code for me. Teach me & guide me."```_
